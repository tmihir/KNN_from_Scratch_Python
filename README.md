# KNN_from_Scratch_Python
Implemented KNN algorithm from scratch using Python to Predict 5 years Target

* Implemented K-Nearest Neighbor Classifier algorithm from Scratch
* Trained and tested model to predict the 5 Years Star player target
* Implemented algorithm for multi-row train and test data set
* Algorithm can take dynamic K-values to calculate the neighbor
* Studied performance level of Scikit-learn model and achieved accuarcy near to library based model
